# Ansible

This repository contains Ansible automation scripts that help in automating infrastructure and software configurations.

## Introduction

Ansible is a powerful IT automation tool that can automate infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, and more. Because Ansible is all about automation, it requires instructions to accomplish each job. With everything written down in simple script form, it's easy to do version control. The practical result of this is a major contribution to the "infrastructure as code" movement in IT: the idea that the maintenance of server and client infrastructure can and should be treated the same as software development, with repositories of self-documenting, proven, and executable solutions capable of running an organization regardless of staff changes. This repository is a collection of my Ansible playbooks, roles, and automation scripts for various tasks and projects.


Each project is organized in its respective folder with detailed instructions.

## Requirements

To run the playbooks in this repository, ensure you have:

- Ansible installed (version 2.9+)
- Python 3+
- Proper permissions to run Ansible commands
- Access to the necessary infrastructure (e.g., servers, cloud instances)
